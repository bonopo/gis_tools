    "Jupyter Notebook that extracts the catchment area given a DEM (possbily stiched together in the other jupyter notebook) and the user input for drainage points. The script works in the local CRS of the DEM!!!!! Therefore, you have to adjust the snap tolerance according to your DEM (how accurate is it? Could there be a false basin?), your needs (how are sure are you about the pour point you set in the map). Most projected CRS are in meters, however if you work in a geographic CRS (eg WGS84), you have to adjust the snap tolerance accordingly (or even better work in a projected CRS). \n",
